      <p class="description-text">
        This is a specific formula for achieving a perfectly pink prime rib
        cooked somewhere a shade under medium rare. To use this method you must
        have a full-sized, modern oven with a digital temperature setting that
        indicates twhen it is preheated. Older ovens with manual controls can
        vary greatly, and the doors may not have the proper insulation.
